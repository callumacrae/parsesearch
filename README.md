# parsesearch

A command line tool for searching for things in a project that regex isn't
suited forâ€”e.g., a Vue component that uses both `v-model` and `v-on:input`.

(if anyone is good at naming things please help)

## Usage

```
Usage: parsesearch [options] <match> [file...]

Utility to search for code in a project using a parser, not regex

Arguments:
  match                     The match to search for
  file                      The file(s) to search

Options:
  -p, --parser <parser>     The parser to use (choices: "vue-sfc", default: "vue-sfc")
  -f, --format <formatter>  The formatter to output with (choices: "pretty", "json",
                            "quickfix", default: "pretty")
  --color                   Force color output
  --no-color                Force no color output
  -h, --help                display help for command
```

The following finds all Vue components using both `@input` and `v-model`:

```
$ npx parsesearch "@input v-model"
```

It does a bit of parsing, so `v-on:input` and `@input` are considered to be the
same. It's not very good at it yet though and I can't work out how to use the
actual Vue parser for this side of things.
